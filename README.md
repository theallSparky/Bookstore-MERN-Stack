# Bookstore-MERN-Stack

Welcome to my first MERN stack project! The purpose of this application is to log out a list of books and their associated authors! As a MERN Stack application, this application has been built using MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js! 

How to start!

Fork a copy of this repository, then clone it into a folder onto your local machine. Open this folder with your code editor / IDE of choice, and run 'npm i' for both the frontend and the backend folders.

After both package.json files have been created (with necessary dependencies installed) navigate to your localhost:5173 to see your  own local MERN-Bookstore.

Stretch Goals Include:
-List Books alphabetically (with the option of reverse alphabetical order)
-Authors page

This project was inspired by FreeCodeCamp's youtube video at 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA'.
